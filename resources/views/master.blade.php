        <p>
        Medicaid non-emergency medical transportation (NEMT) is an important benefit
for beneficiaries who need to get to and from medical services but have no means of
transportation.
        </p>
        <p>
        Patients may require NEMT for a variety of reasons, including: lack of a
        valid driverâ€™s license, lack of a working vehicle, geographic isolation,
        or the inability to take traditional transportation for physical, mental,
        or developmental reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
        Devoted Transportation is an NEMT company whose mission is to deliver
        the highest customer services to our clients throughout Durham and the
        surrounding areas.
